      <h1>A bold new beginning of the amazing story</h1>
      <p>
        His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now
        lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this
        harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his
        son to do the same.

          <h2>An End And A New Beginning</h2>
          <p>
            As 2018's God Of War begins, Kratos has somehow traveled to the
            realm of the Norse gods. He lives a quiet life in the wilderness
            with his new wife, Faye, and their son, Atreus. Instead of the
            Blades Of Chaos, he now wields the magical Leviathan Axe.
            Unfortunately, this new life is shattered when Faye dies. Kratos
            burns her body in a funeral pyre and gathers her ashes. Soon after,
            an odd, tattooed man arrives at their home. He has godlike powers of
            his own, and he and Kratos engage in a brutal fight that destroys
            much of the nearby landscape. Kratos snaps the man's neck and dumps
            his body off of a cliff. Afraid that their home is no longer safe,
            Kratos tells Atreus to pack his things. They're going on a quest to
            fulfill Faye's last wish: to have her ashes scattered from the top
            of the highest mountain in all of the nine realms.

          <h2>Witch Of The Woods</h2>
          <p>
            During their journey, they run into a few colorful characters, such
            as the massive World Serpent, Jörmungandr, and the mysterious Witch
            Of The Woods. The Witch helps Kratos and Atreus navigate through the
            mist blocking their path to the mountaintop. Upon reaching the
            summit, the two overhear a conversation above them. It turns out
            that the tattooed man is the Norse god Baldur. He somehow survived
            the fight with Kratos and is joined by Modi and Magni, the sons of
            Thor. After they leave, Kratos and Atreus discover that the man they
            were talking to is Mimir, a wise fae who has been imprisoned in a
            tree. He reveals that the tallest mountain in all of the nine realms
            is actually in the realm of the Giants, Jötunheim. He's the only
            person who knows how to get there, but he requests to have his head
            chopped off so he can escape his eternal prison. Kratos obliges.

          <h2>On The Road To Jötunheim</h2>
          <p>
            The now alive and bodiless Mimir tells Kratos and Atreus what they
            need to do to reach Jötunheim. However, along the way, the trio is
            attacked by Modi and Magni. Kratos manages to kill Magni and Modi
            runs away in fear. Atreus begins coughing up blood after the battle
            but insists that he's fine. Modi later returns to ambush Kratos.
            When he makes some rude comments about his dead mother, Atreus slips
            into a coma after being overcome with godlike rage. Kratos scares
            Modi off again and takes Atreus to Freya for help. Freya tells
            Kratos that Atreus' illness is the result of Kratos never telling
            him that he is a god. Atreus' belief that he is mortal is
            conflicting with his godhood and causing his body to shut down. To
            cure him, Freya tells Kratos that he must retrieve the heart of a
            troll located within the realm of the dead, Helheim. But since that
            realm is extremely cold, his frosty Leviathan Axe will be useless
            there. Luckily, Kratos still has the Blades Of Chaos hidden within
            his home and he manages to retrieve the heart.

          <h2>Dysfunctional Families</h2>
          <p>
            Freya cures Atreus and Kratos tells him that he is a god. This
            revelation soon goes to his head. He starts thinking of mortals as
            lesser than him as his ego grows larger and larger. When they come
            across a battered and bloody Modi — who was beaten by Thor who
            blamed him for Magni's death — Atreus goes against Kratos' wishes
            and stabs him in the throat. Just as they open the portal to
            Jötunheim, Baldur arrives to battle Kratos again. In the ensuing
            fight, Kratos accidentally destroys the Jötunheim portal and Baldur
            kidnaps Atreus. They jump off of the mountain onto the back of a
            dragon. Kratos and Baldur continue to fight, which causes the dragon
            to crash-land at the Bifrost. Before Baldur can use it to summon the
            forces of Asgard, Kratos sends them back into Helheim. While there,
            they witness Baldur having a vision of a past argument with his
            mother, who is revealed to be Freya. She cursed him with an
            immortality spell so he can never die. Upon seeing this familial
            fight between gods, Atreus apologizes to Kratos for his behavior.
