            </a>for God of War </strong>, although only a few have a name. Kratos is the main character, as
          he appears to be on an adventure with his son, Atreus. Several other
          people appeared during the trailer although remained unnamed. Since
          this is a God of War, there were also voices that seemed connected to
          various Norse Gods, one including the World Serpent.

          <h3>Kratos</h3>
          <p>
            Kratos is the Spartan protagonist of the God of War games. Kratos
            was the brother of Deimos and the son of Zeus, God of thunder. He is
            well known for the extreme acts of violence he is capable of, and
            for his signature weapon, the Blades of Chaos, two short blades
            attached to his arms by long chains, allowing for some very
            acrobatic and brutal combat, can be ignited while swinging. These
            blades were first granted to him by Ares, the God of War.
          </p>
          <p>
            After betraying Ares and subsequently losing the blades, Kratos is
            given the Blades of Athena which function identically to the Blades
            of Chaos. As a demigod who later becomes a real god, Kratos is a
            fighter with unusual strength and a quick learner of magic. The name
            Kratos is derived from the minor god in Greek mythology called
            Cratos, though Kratos shows little in common with the character
            apart from his initial loyalty to the Gods. The word "Kratos" means
            'power' in Greek

          <h3>Atreus</h3>
          <p>
            Atreus was conceived between the Greek demigod-turned-God of War,
            Kratos and a Jötunn named Laufey, whom he called Faye. He was a
            sickly child and only recently grew healthy enough to travel. Not
            much is known about his past other than the fact Kratos was rarely
            home because he was practicing control over his rage, which Atreus
            misinterprets as hunting. Faye had passed away sometime later,
            although the causes are still unknown.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the companion book God of War: Lore and Legends, some details
            about his early life are given. Atreus created a journal with the
            help of his mother Faye, who told him that it was important to
            record his thoughts, whether they were happy or sad. After years of
            his 'practice journal', he finally started his real journal, an
            occasion that they celebrated by throwing the practice pages into
            the fire. In his journal, Atreus noted many incidents about his
            sickness and about his father, whom, he remarked, he barely even
            knew.

          <h3>Freya</h3>
          <p>
            Little is known about her childhood, aside from being the daughter
            of Njörd, as well as the sister of Freyr. Freya had been a leader of
            the Vanir gods during the Aesir-Vanir War and eventually agreed to
            marry Odin in order to bring peace between the two sides. Freya
            clearly did not enjoy this, due to her own distaste for the Aesir,
            especially after they unjustly imprisoned, tortured and nearly
            killed her brother Freyr. During that time, she became the Queen of
            the Valkyries. Also some time during her marriage to Odin, Odin
            began to learn the ways of Freya's magic and began using it for
            unjust purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Hrimthur offered Odin to build Asgard new walls to replace the
            old ones, he requested to receive only a private audience with Freya
            should he complete the project within two years in return. When he
            won the wager, Hrimthur whispered something to her with Mimir
            suspecting that he had embedded some weakness into the walls and
            passed this knowledge onto Freya, before being betrayed and killed
            by Thor. While she and Odin were acknowledged by Mimir to be
            genuinely in love, Freya eventually chose to leave Odin due to his
            unjust ways.
