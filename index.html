        <h3>Game Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son
          determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control
          the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world
          with his son. His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus behind him,
          Kratos now lives in the realm of Norse deities and monsters. It’s in
          this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive, and not
          only teach his son to do the same… but also prevent him from repeating
          the Ghost of Sparta’s bloodstained mistakes. This staggering
          reimagining of God of War combines all the hallmarks of the iconic
          series – brutal combat, epic boss fights, and breathtaking scale – and
          fuses them with a powerful and moving narrative that re-establishes
          Kratos’ world.
